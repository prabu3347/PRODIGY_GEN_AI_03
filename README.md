**Task 3 – Text Generation with Markov Chains**  
**Internship:** Generative AI – Prodigy Infotech

---

## 📝 Description

This task implements **text generation** using the classic **Markov Chain algorithm**. It builds a probabilistic model based on input text and predicts the next word by calculating the statistical likelihood of word sequences. Unlike transformer-based models, Markov Chains offer a simple yet effective approach for generating readable text from small datasets.

## ✅ Outcome

Successfully implemented a Markov Chain-based text generator. Given sample input text, the model learned word transitions and produced human-like sequences. This task demonstrates foundational concepts in probabilistic language modeling.
